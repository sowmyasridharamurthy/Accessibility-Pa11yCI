Accessibility Test
===================

This is a simple Accessibility test with pa11y and pa11y-ci.
There are multiple options available out there to carry out accessibility scans for UI. 
And no one tool can provide scan against all the WCAG standards. 

A combination of tools may help you achieve a good coverage of 40-50%.
