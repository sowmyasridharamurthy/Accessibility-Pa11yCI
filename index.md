## Welcome to Accessibility Test using pa11y & pa11y-ci

Accessibility test is one of the important non-functional tests to be performed on UI. Designing and developing an inclusive UI should be taken as bottom line mantra for all organizations.Its a known fact that with better reach and visibility the products or services can have a better reach. 

Automating the accessibility tests reduces massive manual effort, having said that no tool would provide 100% scan against the WCAG accessibility standards. we should just try to mix and match different tools to achieve atleast 40-50% of coverage. So Manual effort is inevitable, what we are trying to deal here is reduing the rest 50% effort. 


Pa11y and Pa11y is one of the great tool to use for accessibility tests. This is a small project using a random url for tests, try to replace the URL's with the ones of your interest.
